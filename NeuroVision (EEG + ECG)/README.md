# Introduction

Electroencephalography (EEG) measures brain electrical activity across different frequency bands such as Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, being a widely used tool to investigate cognitive, emotional, and neurological states. Meanwhile, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a sensitive marker of autonomic nervous system activity, reflecting the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, and is strongly associated with emotional states, stress, attention, and mental health.

There is growing scientific evidence about the dynamic interaction between the central nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. Although the heart has an intrinsic neural network, its function is directly linked to the brain through well-established neurophysiological pathways such as the vagus nerve. Understanding this relationship is fundamental to advancing fields like emotional regulation, mental health, biofeedback, and applied neuroscience.

# Objective

This project aims to develop a low-cost experimental platform capable of capturing, synchronizing, and analyzing EEG and HRV data simultaneously. The proposal seeks to explore how different sensory stimuli, such as music, modulate the relationship between brain activity and autonomic cardiac regulation.

Although the initial data analysis can be performed using conventional statistical methods, the use of machine learning algorithms is considered an optional and complementary step, intended for when larger datasets are available. Machine learning will serve to enhance the detection of complex patterns and interrelations that may not be easily visible through direct analyses, but it is not a requirement for the initial phase of the project.

# Scientific Hypothesis

The central hypothesis is that emotional states induced by sensory stimuli, such as music, generate simultaneous physiological responses detectable both in EEG signals and HRV metrics. Integrated analysis of these signals may reveal biometric patterns characterizing the functional interaction between the brain and the cardiovascular system.

# Technical Challenges

The main challenges of this project involve acquiring biological signals with sufficient quality using affordable hardware, precise synchronization of EEG and HRV data, and the need for well-defined experimental protocols to ensure reproducibility of results. Additionally, in the project expansion phase, adopting machine learning may present specific challenges related to data curation, variable definition, model building, and result validation.

# Expected Results

The expected outcomes include the identification of biometric patterns representing brain-heart co-regulation, as well as the development of an open-source tool enabling joint EEG and HRV analysis. This work may contribute to research areas such as psychophysiology, mental health, personal neurotechnology, and the development of biofeedback systems.

# Cost and Accessibility

While the project is founded on accessibility principles, the main cost limitation lies in EEG equipment, which is still not widely available in low-cost open-source versions. However, the choice of photoplethysmography-based cardiac sensors and affordable microcontrollers aims to significantly reduce costs and democratize access to research in this area.

# Open Call

This text is an open invitation to collaboration from researchers, developers, neurotechnology enthusiasts, biohackers, and anyone interested in exploring brain-heart interaction. The collaborative construction of this project aims to generate free, accessible knowledge applicable both in academic research and in technological innovations focused on well-being and self-awareness.
